        <p> Aoshima (青島) or known as Cat Island (猫の島) is an island known for it's large population of cats. The island is roughly 1 mile (1.6 km) long.[citation needed] It was formerly part of Nagahama in Kita District, but as of 2005, is part of Ōzu. The ratio between cats and humans on that island is 10:1, and there are only about 50 human residents (aged 75 and older). </p>
        <p>In February 2018, it was reported by Ehime Shimbun that all cats on the island would be spayed or neutered in order to lower the feline population as a response to the declining human population.[3] By October, 210 cats had been spayed and neutered, with another estimated 10 cats uncaptured that had been hidden by a resident who opposed the program</p>
