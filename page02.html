        <br/>
        <p> Simply put, they aren't. Stays are way more friendly and can be pet. They're also was more sociable. Feral cats in the meantime are wild cats, where they barely, if ever, had contact with humans, making them terrified of us. They cannot be domesticated at all, while strays can be. Strays can also become feral overtime as they talk to humans less, but not vise versa.</p>
        <h3 class= "sectionHeader">How does a cat become feral?</h3>
        <p>When domestic cats are dumped, abused, or lost, overtime they revert to their wild roots. They usually don't survive very long unless they find a colony. </p>
